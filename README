gpicker support for Erlang function documentation
-------------------------------------------------

Erlang documentation is quite inconvenient to use. So I decided to
use gpicker for quick browsing of available modules/functions and
navigation to their corresponding html documentation.

You will need latest gpicker from git
(http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/gpicker (post bugreports here)
or http://github.com/alk/gpicker).

You'll need to pre-process erlang html documentation. ./run-indexer.sh
does that. But you may need to edit path to erlang docs in it. This
script outputs documentation index as a lisp list to standard
output. Redirect it to ~/erdoc-index.lisp. Note that this script
assumes that your OS supports sufficiently large argument list for
processes. Recent Linux kernels don't have any limit here. But you may
need some fixes on other OSes. Patches are welcome.

Place erdoc.el in a place where emacs will find it and arrange it's
loading.

My .emacs has following lines:

(autoload 'erdoc-doc "erdoc" nil t)
(add-hook 'erlang-mode-hook
          #'(lambda ()
              (local-set-key (kbd "s-q") 'erdoc-doc)))

This arranges autoload of erdoc and binds erdoc-doc to Super-q. Super
is 'a button with flag' on most keyboards and Command on mac's.

NOTE: Current erdoc.el also relies on w3m for displaying of html. Change
*erdoc-browse-url-function* to browse-url to use default browser.
NOTE: it seems that you'll need w3m-el-snapshot on debian/ubuntu, not
w3m-el for recent emacs.
